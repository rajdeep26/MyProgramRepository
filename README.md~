MyProgramRepository
===================

In my Student life at Goa College of Engineering i have written so many &lt;programs> for the last four years. But now when i try to search for those programs, i couldn't find them, coz they are scattered all over my hard-disk. So i thought of building a simple Web-app to manage them and to keep them all in one place and i.e in a Database. 

This is a Simple PHP-MySQL Web App, which is used to store programs and to manage them, i.e performing simple operation like EDIT or DELETE.

The Web App is built using PHP, MySQL, and Twitter's bootstrap Framework. 

In the AddProgram.php file, I have embedded an ACE Editor to write programs.

The ACE Editor has many such as, 
Syntax highlighting for over 60 languages (TextMate/Sublime Text.tmlanguage files can be imported)
Over 20 themes (TextMate/Sublime Text .tmtheme files can be imported)
Automatic indent and outdent
An optional command line
Handles huge documents (four million lines seems to be the limit!)
Fully customizable key bindings including vim and Emacs modes
Search and replace with regular expressions
Highlight matching parentheses
Toggle between soft tabs and real tabs
Displays hidden characters
Drag and drop text using the mouse
Line wrapping
Code folding
Multiple cursors and selections
Live syntax checker (currently JavaScript/CoffeeScript/CSS/XQuery)
Cut, copy, and paste functionality
